            <h2>Moving 13,000 km away from home and yeah! “Away from home” is like living life in different lifetime.</h2>
                
                <p></p>This is a personal post that I always keep in my heart. Home-boy was always my basic definition if you ask a friend of mine of who I am. I was never meant to be away. I was that person; the one you go home to after a long day of work or a week of school or a two year contract from a job you dreamt of. The one who will fetch you in the airport and not bring you back to say goodbye because separation anxiety is a life-threatening illness that I will live forever.
                But… one day, in a snap. A pivotal decision turn my world around; I got fed up with the easy life I’ve embracing for a long time, living a mediocre decisions and outgrowing the competitive in me that eat out the rest of my existence. So I jump in to the unknown, where everyone I met and will meet will be the first time; pronouncing my name properly heck spell it out and just slowly knowing everybody of what’s their favourite colour or how they like their coffee — black or creamy.</p>

            <h2>has it been almost two years?</h2>
            <p>Almost two years of getting know a soul, blending in with the culture and being mesmerized every time the CN Tower is in sight. At some point I can say I am a local but most of the time, I’m just a pigment of the never ending growth of this little organism — Canada. almost two years; I did it alone, did it scared, did it broke and did it amazed. Two years of falling in love of what  I become and who I am becoming.Home is still home and family is still a top priority but maaaaan! This is a once in a lifetime… and I will never get tired of experiencing and taking photographs of every sceneries and season just like in a POSTCARD. Sooooo, I'm freezing every moment and put in a frame and let my journey here become a love letter that I will send to the people I love the most..
                 Here's to the caviar dream and the steak-sauce life I've been daydreaming of.
